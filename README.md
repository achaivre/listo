README

Our app, listo, allows the user to make multiple lists and then create tasks inside of the list.

These lists and tasks can be updated, deleted and marked complete.

Each user only sees what lists and tasks that they create themselves and can sort tasks in a list by their priority.

A user can also switch to spanish language on our pages for our spanish users.
